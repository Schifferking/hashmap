# hashmap

This project is an implementation of a hashmap data structure, as taught in a previous lesson.

More information here: [The Odin's project page](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hashmap).

## to-do

Consider following ideas to continue developing hash implementation:

- Use a linked list for each entry to store keys that end with same index value
- Research and implement other hashing methods (specially if using other type of value for key)
